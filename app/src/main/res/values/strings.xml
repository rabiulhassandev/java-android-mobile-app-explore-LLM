    <!-- LLM History -->
    <string name="chatgpt_history">ChatGPT is a conversational AI developed by OpenAI based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture. The first version of ChatGPT was released in November 2022, built on GPT-3.5, and quickly gained worldwide attention for its ability to generate human-like text responses. OpenAI later enhanced ChatGPT with GPT-4, introducing capabilities like better reasoning, code generation, and multimodal input (text and image). ChatGPT became a cornerstone in public understanding of LLMs, setting new standards in AI-assisted communication, education, and productivity.</string>
    <string name="gemini_history">Gemini is a family of large language models developed by Google DeepMind as the successor to its PaLM 2 models. The first version of Gemini was released in December 2023, aiming to integrate deep reasoning, multimodal understanding (text, code, image, and more), and efficiency in deployment. Google designed Gemini to compete directly with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and integrated it into various services such as Bard, which was later rebranded as Gemini. This model reflects Google’s deep research into combining language understanding with real-world problem solving.</string>
    <string name="claude_history">Claude is an LLM developed by Anthropic, a company founded by former OpenAI researchers focused on building safe and steerable AI. Named after Claude Shannon, the father of information theory, the first version of Claude launched in March 2023. Anthropic emphasizes Constitutional AI, where Claude is trained to follow a set of guiding principles for safety and ethics. Unlike other models, Claude aims to be more helpful, harmless, and honest, and it is often praised for its balanced and polite responses. Claude is used by developers and enterprises looking for a controllable and transparent AI system.</string>
    <string name="tongyi_history">Tongyi Qianwen is a Chinese large language model developed by Alibaba Cloud. Officially released in April 2023, it became one of the leading AI models in China, supporting both Chinese and English language tasks. The name translates to “truth from a thousand questions,” highlighting its purpose as a comprehensive knowledge engine. Alibaba has integrated Tongyi into products like DingTalk (work collaboration tool) and Tmall Genie (voice assistant). It represents China’s significant efforts in advancing homegrown AI technologies, especially in the face of international competition.</string>
    <string name="tigerllm_history">TigerLLM is a Bangladeshi initiative in the field of large language models. Launched in June 2024, it marks one of the first major contributions from Bangladesh to the AI ecosystem. TigerLLM was developed to support Bangla and multilingual processing, tailored to local linguistic and cultural needs. Its focus is on improving AI accessibility for South Asian communities, enabling applications in education, customer service, and digital content generation. TigerLLM symbolizes the growing interest and capability in AI development across emerging economies.</string>
